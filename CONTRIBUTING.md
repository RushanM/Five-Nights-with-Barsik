# Contribution Guidelines for 2025

> **Note:** This document supplements the main [project license](/LICENSE.md) and details the rights and obligations of contributors. Special attention should be paid to [Section 6. Community Contributions and Use of Ideas](/LICENSE.md#1-community-contributions-and-use-of-ideas) in the license.

## 1. Community Contributions and Use of Ideas

* By providing contributions to the original project (through pull requests or other mechanisms), you agree that your contribution will be distributed under the terms of [this license](/LICENSE.md);
* The copyright holder of the original project has the right to accept, reject, or modify any contribution at their discretion;
* Authorship of the contribution remains with its author and will be indicated in the edit history and list of creators;
* Making a contribution does not give the right to be considered a co-author of the original project as a whole, unless explicitly stated by the copyright holder.

## 2. Patent Grant

It is prohibited to use the project or its modifications to circumvent patents, licenses, or other rights of third parties. The person distributing the modification declares that they do not use the project for deliberate infringement of third-party rights.

## 3. Compatibility with Other Licenses

### 3.1. License Status

The [project license](/LICENSE.md) is not automatically approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) or recognized by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) as free software, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### 3.2. Principle of Preserving Third-Party Component Conditions

When including third-party components (code, media, libraries) in the repository that are distributed under their own licenses, these original licenses remain in force. When distributing compiled works (builds), it is necessary to:

* Preserve copyright notices and license texts required by the original licenses;
* Explicitly indicate in the build description and/or in the THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES file (or equivalent) which files/directories are under which licenses;
* Not relicense third-party files under this license without explicit written permission from their copyright holders.

### 3.3. General Rule for Conflicting Conditions

If the same file/component simultaneously falls under the requirements of several licenses, the distribution of rights and obligations takes into account **all** applicable conditions; in practice, this means that you must comply with the most stringent requirements from the set (for example, the requirement to preserve a notice or the requirement to provide source code). If compliance with all requirements is impossible, integration of such a component is prohibited or requires permission from the copyright holder(s).

## 4. Notification Procedure and Issue Resolution

* The author of a commercial modification must, at the request of the copyright holder, provide one of the following types of confirmation of compliance with the criteria for significant changes:
* * Project screenshots or videos demonstrating new content or transformed original content;
* * A list of added or transformed game mechanics with their brief description;
* * Information about the size and content of added or replaced resources;
* * A comparative table or list showing the volume and nature of changes made;
* In cases where the build is commercial and access to it is only available from the seller, the copyright holder may request demonstration/trial access to verify compliance. Such a request must be fulfilled within 15 calendar days.
