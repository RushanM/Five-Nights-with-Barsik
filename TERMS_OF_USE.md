* Publication of copyrighted media resources on wiki projects (Fandom, wiki.gg, etc.) dedicated to the project is permitted;
* Use of copyrighted media resources in non-commercial modifications, builds, and fan works is allowed with proper attribution;
* For commercial use of media resources, the same rules apply as in [Section 3 of the license](/LICENSE.md#3-commercial-use);
* You may create and publish individual screenshots of the original project without attribution as standalone images, including posting on social networks, messengers, and other platforms;
* You may store and transfer the project's media resources through file-sharing services without attribution. However, public distribution of such links for commercial purposes (e.g., on forums or websites) must be accompanied by reference to the original project;
* Use of copyrighted media resources in third-party projects (not modifications) is allowed with proper attribution and source reference.

## 4. Prohibited Uses

### 4.1. Critical Systems

The project is not intended or certified for use in systems where failure could lead to death, bodily harm, or serious material damage (including but not limited to: medical equipment, aviation, nuclear power, traffic control systems). Any such use is prohibited without prior written consent of the copyright holder and appropriate certification of the user.

### 4.2. Political Use

Use of the project, its modifications, or media resources for political campaigning, propaganda, election campaigns, or in materials of a partisan nature is prohibited without written consent from the copyright holder. This restriction is established by the copyright holder within their rights to control the use of the work and is aimed at preventing the association of the project with any political views or movements.

**Clarification:** The prohibition does not extend to the incidental presence of political elements in the background (for example, posters in the background of a stream). Active use of the project to express political views or to attract an audience to political goals is considered a violation.

### 4.3. Machine Learning and AI

Use of the source code, media resources, or their derivatives for automatic processing for the purpose of training, fine-tuning, inference, or creating datasets for machine learning and generative models is prohibited without prior written consent of the copyright holder. When providing such consent, explicit indication of the source and transfer of terms of use in the model documentation is required.

**Exceptions:** Use of integrated development environments (IDEs) with AI-based auto-completion features when developing project modifications is permitted. Use of AI to create content in modifications based on project materials (without training AI on these materials) is also permitted.

**Clarifications:**

* Creating content (videos, images, etc.) using AI generative tools where project materials are used as prompts or inputs is permitted, provided proper attribution is included as specified in [Section 1](#1-use-in-media-and-live-streams);
* This differs from training AI models on project materials (which requires permission) as it uses existing AI models to generate new content based on project elements;
* The use of AI-generated content is subject to the same attribution requirements as manually created content.

## 5. Server Use and API Services

* If the project or its modifications are used in public or commercial services (including server logic, APIs, and SaaS) where end users receive functionality based on the project, the modification author must provide accessible attribution to users (in the service description, documentation, or in the "About" section), even if the source code is not publicly distributed;
* Attribution must include the name of the original project, the copyright holder's name, and, if possible, a link to the original project;
* For server use in closed corporate environments where only company employees have access, it is sufficient to indicate attribution in internal documentation. Internal documentation includes: project technical documentation, README files in corporate repositories, company wiki pages, official records in project management systems, or any other documents available to employees that contain information about the technologies used.

## 6. Platforms, Formats, and Digital Assets

### 6.1. NFTs and Digital Assets

Creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on project elements is only permitted with written permission from the copyright holder.

### 6.2. Virtual Worlds

Use of characters, design elements, or other components of the project in virtual worlds (e.g., VRChat, Minecraft, Roblox) and metaverses is regulated as follows:

* Creation of 3D models of project characters for use in virtual worlds falls under "third-party works" in [Section 3](#3-use-of-characters-and-project-elements-in-third-party-works) and requires attribution;
* End users of such models are not required to provide attribution.

### 6.3. Cloud Gaming Services

Regulated by the server use rules from [Section 5](#5-server-use-and-api-services).
