## Antonio's Call to PsyCo

# "Antonio's Call to PsyCo" is the first cutscene in the game, shown after clicking the "Start Game" button.
# It tells the player that strangers have entered the main character's house, and he calls PsyCo for help.
# After this cutscene, the player is shown a message from PsyCo.
# The cutscene has an alternative version that activates during the in-game Halloween event.
# During Halloween, the game becomes spookier to match the holiday theme, and the dialogues reflect this darker tone.

antonio-to-psyco-1 = Two cats of some kind and plush toys.
antonio-to-psyco-2 = — Hmm... I see. Perhaps we should set up video surveillance?
antonio-to-psyco-3 = Yes, you're right.
antonio-to-psyco-4 = — Well, that's exactly what we do for cases like this.
antonio-to-psyco-5 = Should I come over myself?
antonio-to-psyco-6 = — No, we'll come to you. You're not too far away.
antonio-to-psyco-7 = Alright, I'll be waiting.

antonio-to-psyco-1-halloween = T-two cats of some kind and plush toys... I have no idea where they came from, but...
antonio-to-psyco-2-halloween = — I see. Seems like a standard case, we'll set up video surveillance.
antonio-to-psyco-3-halloween = U-umm... Will that help get rid of them?? I c-can't live like this!
antonio-to-psyco-4-halloween = — No, but it will add to our evidence that you're not lying to us.
antonio-to-psyco-5-halloween = You think I'm crazy?...
antonio-to-psyco-6-halloween = — Of course "not," Mr. Antonio! Maybe just a little, since you blurted out your address at the start of our conversation.
antonio-to-psyco-7-halloween = Oh... That... That was out of fear, I'm usually alone at home and no one else...

## PsyCo's Message

psyco-message = Hello again. I'll meet with you only after the night trials. We need to understand exactly what's happening in your house. What's your task, you ask? It's simple: we've installed cameras throughout your house, and you need to watch if anyone appears on them. We'll also be monitoring the cameras. Unfortunately, some of the cameras might not work. And yes... Remember that mask? Wear it only in emergency situations. For example, when one of them enters your room. But keep in mind: it's not safe to wear it for long periods. It may contain toxins left from the previous case... Let me remind you of your own words: your enemies are toys and cats. Good luck!

## Game

call-1-1 = Hello? Antonio?
call-1-1-answer = Yes, it's me
call-1-2 = Hello, Antonio! It's me, Genndy. I called you, just as I promised. I was informed about some suspicious object in your... *break in connection* Hold on, we're having connection issues, wait a moment... *breaks* w.. ait... ai... hat..vir.. Looks like we can't talk properly. That's a shame. Let's continue tomorrow. If something happens to you, we'll come for you, we're available 24/7. Anyway, good luck and... bye.
call-2 = Hello, it's Genndy. I'm very sorry I couldn't talk to you properly yesterday. Something was wrong with the connection, but let's not dwell on that. So here's what happened yesterday: We noticed a robot in your house that looks like an ordinary teddy bear, so be careful and track it through the tablet. As you've already noticed, the tablet isn't the best, we couldn't afford anything better, and we haven't had cases like yours before. They say there's a workshop where they make robots, some kind of smart ones.. I didn't believe it then, but now.. Maybe we should really visit them to find out if some toy-like robot has escaped from them? Ugh.. Anyway, don't get discouraged, we'll figure all this out! Bye.
call-3 = Hello, it's Genndy! Well, congratulations, you're doing great! Unfortunately, you'll have to stay like this for a few more nights, it's necessary for the case. This time I won't keep you long, as I need to hurry myself. We haven't found anything significant in your house yet, nothing that could attract these animals and robots. I don't understand the motive of these creatures, maybe some kind of revenge? What do you think? Alright, I said I wouldn't keep you, so goodbye. I wish you luck.
call-4 = Hello, it's Genndy again. There's bad news. Have you seen the cat that camera six is currently looking at? It turns out she can recognize you as a human, even if you're wearing a mask. I think you need to handle her differently, because she's not in a hurry to get to you. To be honest, she has the character of a normal cat. When we tried to get closer to her, she just ran away! Maybe you'll be safe if you put on the mask, in my opinion she's not such a dangerous enemy to you. In any case, we can send you support if anything goes wrong. We'll continue our conversation tomorrow.
call-5 = Hello, uh.. *break* ..calling to tell you that *break* What's going on! *break* Well, okay, bye. Goo.. *break* luck.
call-6 = Hello, this is Genndy. I apologize for yesterday's connection problems. Truly, I'm very sorry that we couldn't prevent this incident.. Okay.. And.. I was told there's some yellow cat, can you imagine? I can't either, that's why I told those who check the cameras that they might be seeing things. After all, until now and currently in your house there's only this cat and that cat, and.. this bear and dog. In a day, we'll remove all of them and you'll be able to sleep peacefully. But I won't be able to be present because I have personal matters at home. So.. good night to you. Bye.
