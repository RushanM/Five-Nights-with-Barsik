}}'''Five Nights with Barsik 2''' (abbreviated as '''FNwB2''', in Russian '''Пять ночей с Барсиком 2''' and '''ПНСБ2''', pronounced as '''Pyat nochey s Barsikom dva''' and '''PNSB dva''', <small>formerly known as ''Five Nights at Barsik's 2'' and ''FNaB2''</small>) is the second installment in the [[Five Nights with Barsik series|Five Nights with Barsik series]], released by [[P4shtet]] in September 2015. In May 2017, [[Deflecta]] began developing version 2.0, which has not been released yet. The game tells the story of events that happened to [[Maxim Rakintsev (FNwB)|Maxim Rakintsev]] in the [[Funny Cat Hotel]]. This is the second game in the Five Nights with Barsik trilogy and currently remains in a terrible state.

== Plot ==
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Unfortunately, the game's plot has many holes, but the upcoming [[Five Nights with Barsik 2 2.0 update|2.0 update]] will likely fix many of them.

The main character came across a job advertisement in the newspaper for a security guard position at the [[Funny Cat Hotel]] and decided to apply for the job. For protection against an [[Jake|animatronic]] that might appear at night, he was provided only with doors and security cameras.

=== During the game's events ===
Every night, a hotel employee calls [[Maxim Rakintsev (FNwB)|Maxim Rakintsev]] and provides essential information about the job. On the third night, he is informed about a burned-down warehouse near the hotel where the real mascot of the [[Funny Cat Hotel]] was destroyed. On the fourth night, after a loud scream, the call suddenly ends, and on the sixth night, the employee tells about an accident: a child was hospitalized after being harmed by an animatronic.
