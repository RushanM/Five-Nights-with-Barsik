}}'''Five Nights with [[Barsik]]''' (abbreviated as '''FNw[[Barsik|B]]''', in Russian '''Пять ночей с [[Barsik|Барсиком]]''' and '''ПНС[[Barsik|Б]]''', pronounced as '''Pyat nochey s [[Barsik|Barsikom]]''' and '''PNS[[Barsik|B]]''', <small>formerly known as ''Five Nights at [[Barsik|Barsik's]]'' and ''FNa[[Barsik|B]]''</small>) is a video game conceived by [[P4shtet]], inspired by the [[Five Nights at Freddy's series|Five Nights at Freddy's]], and developed by [[Deflecta]]. Originally, the development was handled by [[P4shtet]], but since 2017, the rights were transferred to [[Deflecta]]. FNwB tells the story of events happening to the main character [[Antonio]]. It is the first installment in the [[Five Nights with Barsik trilogy|FNwB trilogy]] and currently the only one presented in a good state—[[Five Nights with Barsik series|the two subsequent entries]] have not yet received major [[2.0 updates|updates]].

== Gameplay ==
[[Antonio|Player]] must survive seven nights, after which they move to a new house. Each night features different antagonists. In the first night, [[Diamond Barsik]] and [[Teddy Bear]] are active. Second night introduces [[Dogy]]. The third night brings [[Barsik]]. On the fourth night appears [[Matilda]], and on the fifth night [[Yellow Cat]] makes an appearance. Each night, [[Genndy]] calls [[Antonio]] to advise on how to fend off the enemies.

== Plot ==
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
There are two versions of the plot, corresponding to different versions of FNwB.

Initially, FNwB did not have a clear plot, as it had very poor presentation: bad English translation, random unconnected scenes. But in the [[Five Nights with Barsik 2.0 update|2.0 update]], the plot and its delivery were improved, making FNwB more player-friendly and more logical. Unfortunately, this did not fix many plot holes that existed and appeared afterward. Currently, the [[Five Nights with Barsik 3.0 update|3.0 update]] is planned, and it is expected to bring further improvements.

<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" data-expandtext="Show" data-collapsetext="Hide" style="width:100%;">
=== Version 1.x plot ===
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
In this version, the events revolve around a character named [[Pavel]]. He lived in his house for five years, and then, after a year, notices the appearance of two animals and two toys that are trying to kill him. After consulting a psychologist, he agrees to install security cameras. [[Pavel]] is given a [[Freddy Fazbear Mask|Freddy Fazbear mask]], after which he is told to survive in the house every night until 6 AM. Every night, an unknown person calls him, presumably an employee of the company, who encourages him and tells scary stories. After the fifth night, the [[Psychological Company]] congratulates [[Pavel]] on surviving, warning him not to burn down the house; after the 6th night, the case is declared closed, and after the seventh night, [[Pavel]] burns down the house, finds a new home, and notices that two cats escaped the fire.

=== Version 2.x plot ===
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

==== Before FNwB events ====
[[Antonio]] has been living in his secluded house for several years, away from urban hustle and troubles. However, on one peaceful day, he discovers that stray cats have appeared in his house. Unable to deal with the animals, Antonio contacts the [[Psychological Company]], thinking he is going crazy.

==== During FNwB events ====
[[Antonio]] has telephone conversations with a representative of the [[Psychological Company]]. The company becomes convinced that his concerns are justified and arranges with him to conduct sleepless nights to collect data. During the nights, he receives calls from an employee named [[Genndy]], who not only instructs him but also starts to propose theories about the root cause of the appearance of cats and robots in the house. After the fourth night, one of the employees wonders why [[Genndy|Doc]] cannot remove all the cats, sparing [[Antonio]] the necessity of surviving among them. At the end of the fifth night, [[Antonio]] is attacked by the mother of the kitten [[Barsik]], the cat [[Matilda]], who manages to wound his arm, after which he sits and reflects on why he was not killed. After the fifth night, the [[Psychological Company]] congratulates him on surviving and asks him not to burn down the house; after the sixth night, the case is declared closed, and after the seventh night, [[Antonio]] sets the house on fire, presumably to destroy all cats and toys. He leaves the house, after which firefighters and [[Genndy]] arrive at the fire site, with the latter beginning to suspect [[Antonio]] of arson. In the end, the protagonist finds a new home, and the cats apparently escaped the fire.

==== Endings ====
After the [[Five Nights with Barsik fifth night|fifth night]], [[Antonio]] is told to hold on for two more nights. But he must not burn the house, run away, or hide.

After the [[Five Nights with Barsik sixth night|sixth night]], [[Antonio]] is going to be relocated to [[Alexander Kazakov in Five Nights with Barsik universe|Alexander Kazakov's]] house, if he doesn't mind.

After the [[Five Nights with Barsik seventh night|seventh night]], [[Antonio]] burns down the house and finds a new one. But the cats escaped.

== Title ==
Initially, before the rights were transferred to [[Deflecta]], FNwB was released under the title ''Five Nights at Barsik's''. After the [[Five Nights with Barsik 2.0 Update|2.0 update]], Russian language was added to FNwB, and it received the Russian title "Пять Ночей у Барсика" (note the capitalized "Ночей"). It remained under this title for some time until, for unknown reasons, the English title was changed to "Five Nights at Barsik". Eventually, both titles were corrected: the English became "Five Nights with Barsik," and the Russian became "Пять ночей с Барсиком".
