==== April ====
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
In the spring of 2015, inspired by the popular horror game series [[Five Nights at Freddy's series|"Five Nights at Freddy's"]], Pavel decided to create his own game about his kitten named Barsik, titled "Five Nights At Barsik's."
On April 9 at 11:09 AM, Pavel enthusiastically announced the start of development:

</gallery>
A few hours after the announcement at 6:05 PM, Pavel created a VKontakte community "Five Nights At Barsik's|Five Nights with Barsik" and immediately began searching for a [[Zodli|voice actor]] for the [[Genndy|phone guy]]. At 6:13 PM, [[Kirill Shkliarevsky]] offered his candidacy for voice acting, and Pavel accepted him as a test voice actor.
* By April 19 at 9:04 AM, Pavel had already finished making the camera rotation in the game. At 5:14 PM, he announced that [[Kirill Shkliarevsky|Kirill's]] microphone broke and he needed a new person for voice acting.
* On April 21 at 4:13 PM, Pavel accepted [[Zodli]] as the new voice actor. At 4:14 PM, he announced that a voice actor had been found.
* On April 24 at 9:23 AM, Pavel announced that news about the game would be published on his [[X]] profile. At 9:34 AM, he asked the VKontakte community subscribers how to distribute the game: through [[Game Jolt]] or [[Yandex Disk]]. The [[Game Jolt]] option won.
* On April 26 at 12:34 PM, Pavel created a page on [[Game Jolt]], which is currently abandoned.
* On April 27 at 5:32 PM, Pavel announced that since he only had the demo version of Clickteam Fusion 2.5, not the full version, he could not continue developing the game and asked subscribers to send him the full version.
* On April 28, game tester [[MaksFred]] created an account on [[X]], and at 10:57 AM, Pavel shared the [https://x.com/MaksSchmidt228 link] with his subscribers to support his tester.
* On April 28 at 11:27 AM, Pavel published the first teaser for [[Five Nights with Barsik|FNwB]].
